# LMS-Library-Management-System
Library Management System (LMS) — A simple C++ console-based project built using fundamental programming concepts. It allows admins to add, delete, edit, and view books, while students can search and borrow books. The system uses arrays, loops, and conditionals for data handling and features basic password-protected access.
